**INPUT DOCUMENT TEXT:**
DRAINAGE STUDY FOR THE CREEKSIDE ESTATES PROJECT

Prepared by: Water Resources Engineering
Date: February 20, 2031

FINDINGS:
The project will increase impervious surfaces by 5 acres, resulting in a 15% increase in peak runoff during a 100-year storm event. The southern portion of the site is located within the FEMA 100-year floodplain.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
An on-site detention basin with a capacity of 2.5 acre-feet is required to mitigate the increase in runoff. The finished floor elevation of all structures must be a minimum of 2 feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
