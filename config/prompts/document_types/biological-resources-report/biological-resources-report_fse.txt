FOR THE PINE HILLS ESTATES PROJECT

Prepared for: Pine Hills Development LLC
Prepared by: EcoSphere Consulting
Date: February 10, 2031

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:
The 50-acre project site contains suitable habitat for the California red-legged frog. No individuals were observed during protocol-level surveys. Several protected oak trees are located on the site.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid impacts, a 50-foot buffer should be established around the seasonal drainage. An arborist report is recommended to address potential impacts to oak trees.
