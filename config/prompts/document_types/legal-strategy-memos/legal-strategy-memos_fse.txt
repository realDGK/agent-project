CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED MEMORANDUM

TO: File

DATE: June 15, 2032
RE: City Electric Inc. vs. BuildRight Corp. - Litigation Strategy

ISSUE: Plaintiff has filed a mechanic's lien and stop notice for $450,000.

RECOMMENDATION: Our initial strategy will be to file a motion to release the lien based on a defect in their preliminary notice. Concurrently, we will open settlement discussions, offering to bond around the lien in exchange for a withdrawal of the stop notice to keep loan funds flowing.
