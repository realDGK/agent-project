Prepared for: Industrial Buyers LLC
Prepared by: Clearwater Environmental

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
We have performed a Phase I ESA in conformance with ASTM E1527-13. This assessment has revealed the following recognized environmental conditions (RECs):
1. The historical use of the property as a machine shop.
2. The presence of an adjacent property listed as a leaking underground storage tank site.

We recommend a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment to collect soil and groundwater samples to test for the presence of hazardous substances.
