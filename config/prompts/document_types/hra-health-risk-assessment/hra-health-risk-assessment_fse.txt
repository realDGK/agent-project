HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT
OAKVILLE QUARRY PROJECT

Prepared by: Enviro Air Sciences
Date: July 1, 2031

This HRA evaluates potential health risks from exposure to Diesel Particulate Matter (DPM) during project construction.

CONCLUSION:
The maximum incremental cancer risk for the Maximally Exposed Individual Resident (MEIR) is calculated to be 8.5 in one million, which is below the BAAQMD significance threshold of 10 in one million. The impact is less than significant.
