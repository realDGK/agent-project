its one of your mcp tools, and when i started up this chat i was prompoted that there was an error and it asked me if i wanted to debug it, and i said yes, but then , wait i will just copy here Warning: Failed to start extension 'Cognee': Failed to start the MCP server from configuration `Stdio(Cognee: docker run --rm -i --volume agentgoose_cognee_data:/app/data --volume agentgoose_cognee_db:/app/database --volume agentgoose_cognee_logs:/app/logs agentgoose-cognee-mcp)` `Call to '' failed for 'initialize'.

Enter your instructions, or try asking what goose can do.\nThank you for providing the full error message and context. It seems the `Cognee` extension, which is an MCP tool, is failing to start because its underlying Docker container is timing out. The "Debugging session failed: Path not allowed" error you encountered is likely a symptom of Goose not being able to access certain paths or logs related to the failing Docker container.\n\nTo properly debug this, I need to try running the `docker run` command mentioned in the error directly in the shell. This will help us see the exact output and error messages from Docker, which should give us more insight into why the container is failing to start.\n\nI will now execute the following Docker command:\n`docker run --rm -i --volume agentgoose_cognee_data:/app/data --volume agentgoose_cognee_db:/app/database --volume agentgoose_cognee_logs:/app/logs agentgoose-cognee-mcp`\n\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ shell | developer ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

can you try to access it?  because once i restart you wont remember what you did to try and fix it?
when did your conversation become stored across sessions?  where is it installed? 
can you let me know what extensions you have access to, i think there might be some issues with the docker containers
oh thats right, you are operating with the built in extensions, i have a plan to set you up with the congee extension, but i dont think that has happened yet.  But i am having issues with my developer assistant in continue the mcp tools arent working for it, and i thought i would see if they were working for you, but i forgot you arent sharing any yet
can you look into the continue extension to vs code, its using the /home/scott workspace in wsl
well actually i am not sure if those tools are configured to run on docker, because continue has this block builder compenent as to how you add the mcp tools, and im not sure if that was configured for docker, also the compenents that should have been added to the config file do not match up with the settings in the block builder
here is an error log

can you access the cognee database?
are you getting a specific error message when you attempt to access cognee?  can you please share the exact actions and error message you took when yo uattempted to connect?
are you able to access the congee database via the mcp tool extension?
your toggle extensions on/off settings show cognee with a green light?

well clearly there are some settings that are missconfigured, so i was testing to find out what is the current state.  So you just see no reference to cognee not even an error?
can you access the congee database via an mcp tool?  i am still testing the configuation set up?
can you try one more time i forgot to restart the docker container.. so maybe that was the issue
can you access the cognee database via mcp extensions?
can you connect to the cognee database via the mcp exetnsions?
i am just now getting this configured properly this is part of the test, can you attempt to store some data in there, store the information that cognee database was enabled on 8_9_2025, and then try and retreive it please
can you search the database and find out what data cognee was cleaned of http and api related documentation settings?
how many entries do you see stored in that system>?
whats the second one say?
yeah so can you tell me what the other entry says, there are only 2?\\
thats correct, but why do you think you were not able to retreive that... as an answer to my question that should have been easy
it seems like it should be easier, more robust?
so i think i need to do more configuration because cognee is suppose to have a semantic vector search?
based on my question it should have been symantically similar enough
ok lets put another entry in for testing purposes, lets store in the database, that my cats name is vespera 
ok one more test, can you save the information that my black and white cats name is shadow bane
ok yeah i was attempting to rebuild because it was only doing a keyword search and not the semantic search
yes i beleive its working can you try to save again?
ok can you try again?
ok it might be fixed this time, can you try once more please?
im testing my cognee mcp extension database i had set up for you, and recently attempted to update the embedding model to use semantic storage and retreval but had some errors, can you help me test that is working by storing the data that "my black and white cat's name is shadow bane
can you check the data to see if i have any other cats and what their names are if i do?
we you able to access that via a semantic search rather than a keyword search?
were any graph based nodes created?
understood it seems like its working though.  Lets try this, does shadow bane have a sister?
i guess even though they are both mine that technically does not make them brother and sister, genetically, some might say that its still a family but i guess thats not a diffinitive node based test
well i was trying to do that search because i wasnted to test how detailed the nodes that are being created, so wanted to eliminate the possibility of a semantic retreval. 
so it sounds like you are saying even if its being stored in a graph, you wont have the ability to retreive data based on any of the graph connections?  that makes it sound like the graph is entirely useless?
so im hoping that you are explaining that whatever retreval agent that is processing your quirries and conducting the embeddings, is the one who would conduct the graph relationship connections.   Lets try this, can you store in the system that i have a brother named ryan and a sister named meghan?
can you tell me who ryans sister is?
ok well that must have been retreived using a graph, right?
so its possible it only failed the shadow bane and vespera test because it cant conclusively be confirmed that they are genetic brother and sister
lets try .. can you save that meghan has a cousin named dylan
we are testing the graph retrevial of the cognee memoery system you have attached via an mcp extension.  for the purposes of this test can you store in the system that meghan has a cousin name dylan
ok can you also store that scotts uncle has a daughter named britnay
we are testing the graph retrevial of the cognee memoery system you have attached via an mcp extension.  for the purposes of this test can you store in the system "my uncle has a daughter named britnay" 
why does it take so long to store that?
thats what i was afraid of because i have a massive amount of data that i am going to be preocessing, and if it takes that one for a single sentance how long will it take to process a few legal contracts?
yeah i am going to develop a uploading pipline to where its not goign through here, it would be directly to embedding agents
so i am still testing out the limits of the graph database, can you tell me who ryans cousins are based on the information you have stored?
can you list who ryan is related too?
thats strange it did not identify me? 
no the way that i uploaded the data was that i said i had a brother named ryan, and he had a sister named meghan 
or actually i had that in reverse i had a sister named meghan, and she had a brother named ryan, but it didnt connect it back to me
well that makes me wonder what the point of a graph database is, because if its explicitly stated its no better than a semantic search
ok well i am hoping that it will handle legal contracts where clauses might not be explcitly stated btu a contract addundum 2 should obviously be linked to the contract addundum 1, and things like that
well thats why i am concerned because lets look at the test we just did lets say im person x, and i am related to person 1 and person 2, it should also be able to infer that person 1 and 2 are related through me, just as if the base contract has addendum 1, and addendum 2.  If they are each related to the base contract, they might not explicitly say they are related to eachother, other than just the number.  addenumn 1, will never say its related to addendum 2 because it wouldnt have existed yet.  and sometimes and addundum will just reference the original contract, but not nessisarily relist every subsequent addundm after the original other than using the number in its name
i am going to be using a legal bert for embedding that was not used now, so hopefully that one will be better.  Lets do one more test specifically record that ryan and meghan are both my siblings
it keeps crashing when you try and store to cognee, can you try and save that i am ryans brother in the database
who are ryans cousins?
what model is review this contract?  its not very smart at all, it got about nothing correct with its analysis, but at least its attempting we have that much working

can we test the functionality of our database, can you see if you can identify who is ryans cousin?
you had actually kind of errored on the last embed so maybe it didnt get set, but can you explictly save that ryan and meghan are my sibliings 
save that in the cognee database you are working on right now
\n( O)> you had actually kind of errored on the last embed so maybe it didnt get set, but can you explictly save that ryan\n and meghan are my sibliings
in cognee
can you identify who is cousins with ryan?\n\n
can you look in the congee database and see if you can identify who is cousins with ryan?
who are ryans siblings?
who are my siblings?
ok then i dont think it saved properly i was having some errors but i wanted you to explictly store that ryan and meghan are my siblings
no i am just testing the db
with the connection that ryan is my sibling can you see who is cousins with ryan
it should because i had earlier stated that i have a cousin named britnay
if you know that ryan is my brother and britnay is my cousin, wouldnt that directly imply that britnay is also ryans cousin?
well thats why i am actually testing cognees graph component
there is almost no point to a graph database if it cannot infer nodes and connection.  if it only relies on semantic searching and direct explicit relationship statements there is nothing that graph adds that semantic doesnt
so are you storing the data in the database yourself or are you using the embedding model?
well i think thats the embedding agent that cognee requyires you to provide api keys to configure
i am just bringing that up as evidence there are other models in the loop in which i feel should be able to populate a graph db, regardless if you can or cannot, its more in alignment with what they are trained for
can you see what is not working with the Contract uploader tool on localhost:8081, it will not upload contracts to cognee
run this command ti restart the container and remove the lock temporarily apperently the lock occurs when two entities are trying to access the database at the same time
