# Documentation Migration & Consolidation

## 📚 Previous Documentation Locations

This document tracks the consolidation of scattered documentation into the centralized `/home/scott/docs/` directory.

### Root Directory Files (Archived/Referenced)

|------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| `/home/scott/CLAUDE.md` | ✅ **Keep** | Project-specific Claude instructions | Root (required) |
| `/home/scott/README.md` | 📁 **Archived** | Original project README | `docs/legacy/` |
| `/home/scott/GOOSE_DOCKER_CONFIG.md` | 📁 **Archived** | Goose Docker setup | `docs/legacy/` |
| `/home/scott/agentgoose.md` | 📁 **Archived** | Agent Goose notes | `docs/legacy/` |
| `/home/scott/GITHUB_BACKUP_README.md` | 📁 **Archived** | GitHub backup info | `docs/legacy/` |

### Subdirectory Documentation

## 🔄 Migration Actions

### Completed ✅
- [x] Created centralized documentation directory
- [x] Written comprehensive system overview  
- [x] Documented current implementation status
- [x] Created technical roadmap with priorities
- [x] Comprehensive deployment guide

### In Progress 🔄  
- [ ] Move legacy files to archive
- [ ] Update root README to point to docs/
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Write development contribution guide

### Planned 📝
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Create user manual for web interface
- [ ] Document agent development workflows

## 📋 Action Items

### Immediate Cleanup
```bash
# Create legacy documentation archive
mkdir -p /home/scott/docs/legacy

# Archive scattered documentation
mv /home/scott/README.md /home/scott/docs/legacy/original-README.md
mv /home/scott/GOOSE_DOCKER_CONFIG.md /home/scott/docs/legacy/goose-docker-config.md
mv /home/scott/agentgoose.md /home/scott/docs/legacy/agent-goose-notes.md

# Create new root README pointing to docs/
cat > /home/scott/README.md << 'EOF'
# Agent Orchestration System

Enterprise-grade contract analysis platform with PostgreSQL backend and AI agent orchestration.

## 📚 Documentation

All documentation has been consolidated in the [`/docs`](./docs/) directory:

- **[System Overview](./docs/01-system-overview.md)** - Architecture and capabilities
- **[Current Status](./docs/02-current-implementation.md)** - What's built and operational  
- **[Roadmap](./docs/03-technical-roadmap.md)** - Development priorities
- **[Deployment](./docs/04-deployment-guide.md)** - Setup and configuration

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
cd agent-orchestration
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD="secure-password"
./deploy.sh
```

## 🎯 System Status

- ✅ **PostgreSQL Database**: Production ready with connection pooling
- ✅ **Web Interface**: Functional upload and search
- 🔄 **Agent Orchestration**: Container building (almost ready)
- ✅ **Legacy Goose Integration**: Working

**Latest Update:** August 11, 2025 - PostgreSQL migration complete, eliminated database locking issues.

### Project-Specific Files to Keep
```bash
# These files remain in root as they're required by tools
/home/scott/CLAUDE.md              # Claude Code instructions - REQUIRED
/home/scott/.claude.json           # Claude configuration - REQUIRED  
/home/scott/docker-compose.yml     # Main docker config - REQUIRED
```

## 🎯 Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
- Use descriptive prefixes (01-, 02-, etc.) for ordered documents
- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Include file purpose in name (guide, reference, troubleshooting)

### Content Standards
- Start each document with clear purpose and audience
- Include table of contents for documents >500 words
- Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for major sections)
- Include code examples with language specification
- Add "Next/Previous" navigation links between related documents

### Maintenance Process
- Update documentation with each major feature release
- Review and update roadmap monthly
- Archive outdated documentation rather than deleting
- Keep CHANGELOG.md in each major component directory

**Status:** Documentation consolidation 60% complete. Core architectural and deployment docs ready. API and development docs pending.
