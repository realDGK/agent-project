# Fix for Extraction Quality Issues

## The Problem You Described
Your extraction was:
1. **Missing the main deal value** ($3.5M purchase price)
2. **Grabbing wrong amounts** ($1M insurance requirement instead)
3. **Not labeling amounts meaningfully** (just "extracted_amount")
4. **Not getting full party names** (fragments like "Coyne" instead of "Coyne Development LLC")

## The Root Cause
The AI was doing pattern matching without understanding CONTEXT. It would grab any dollar amount without understanding what it represents.

## The Solution: Context-Aware Extraction

### Key Changes in `fixed_extraction.py`:

1. **Two-Phase Approach**
   - First: Understand what kind of document and what the main deal is about
   - Second: Extract with that context in mind

2. **Explicit Context Rules**
   ```python
   # The prompt explicitly teaches the AI:
   - "Purchase price" = MAIN DEAL VALUE
   - "Insurance/liability" = NOT the deal, just a requirement
   - "Per lot" = Unit price, need to multiply
   ```

3. **Validation Layer**
   - After extraction, validates the results
   - If main transaction is missing, searches specifically for it
   - If an insurance amount snuck in as main value, moves it to "other terms"

4. **Full Name Extraction**
   - Looks for complete legal names in signature blocks
   - Searches for entity suffixes (LLC, Inc, Corp)
   - Won't accept single-word fragments as party names

## How to Use It

### Option 1: Test First
```bash
# Test with the example document
python test_fixed_extraction.py

# This will show you:
# - Whether it finds the $3.5M (not the $1M insurance)
# - Whether it gets full party names
# - Whether each amount has a meaningful label
```

### Option 2: Update Your Main.py
```python
# In main.py, add to imports:
from fixed_extraction import extract_with_fixed_context

# Replace the extraction call in analyze_document:
# OLD:
# ai_result = extract_with_enhanced_precision(cleaned_content, request.filename)

# NEW:
extracted_data = extract_with_fixed_context(cleaned_content, request.filename)
```

### Option 3: Run Side-by-Side Comparison
```python
# Compare old vs new extraction
old_result = extract_with_enhanced_precision(content, filename)
new_result = extract_with_fixed_context(content, filename)

print("OLD extraction:")
print(f"  Main value: {find_main_value(old_result)}")
print(f"  Parties: {old_result.get('parties', [])}")

print("NEW extraction:")  
print(f"  Main value: {find_main_value(new_result)}")
print(f"  Parties: {new_result.get('parties', [])}")
```

## What This Fixes

### Before (Your Current Problem):
```json
{
  "financial_terms": [
    {"amount": 1000000, "description": "extracted_amount"},  // Wrong! This is insurance
    {"amount": 50000, "description": "extracted_amount"}      // No context
  ],
  "parties": [
    {"name": "Coyne"},  // Fragment
    {"name": "Smith"}    // Fragment
  ]
  // Missing the $3.5M entirely!
}
```

### After (With Fix):
```json
{
  "financial_terms": [
    {"amount": 3500000, "description": "Total Purchase Price", "is_primary": true},
    {"amount": 19000, "description": "Price per lot"},
    {"amount": 50000, "description": "Earnest Money Deposit"},
    {"amount": 1000000, "description": "Insurance Requirement", "type": "insurance"}
  ],
  "parties": [
    {"role": "Buyer", "full_legal_name": "Coyne Development LLC", "entity_type": "LLC"},
    {"role": "Seller", "full_legal_name": "Valley Land Holdings, Inc.", "entity_type": "Corporation"}
  ]
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Main Transaction Identification**
   - Specifically looks for "purchase price", "total consideration", etc.
   - Validates amounts > $100k (real estate threshold)
   - Excludes insurance/liability contexts

2. **Context Validation**
   - Checks text around amounts to understand what they represent
   - Skips amounts with "insurance", "liability", "coverage", "bond" nearby

3. **Party Name Completion**
   - Won't accept single-word names without entity suffix
   - Searches for full legal names in signature blocks
   - Looks for "a California limited liability company" type phrases

4. **Meaningful Labels**
   - Every amount gets a description of what it represents
   - No more "extracted_amount" labels
   - Categories like "deposit", "fee", "insurance", "main_transaction"

## Integration with Your Architecture

This fix is:
- **Containerizable** - Pure Python, no external dependencies beyond Gemini
- **Scalable** - Stateless extraction function
- **MCP-ready** - Can be wrapped as an MCP tool
- **HIL-compatible** - Returns confidence scores for review routing

## Next Steps

1. **Test with your problem documents** - Run `test_fixed_extraction.py`
2. **Update main.py** - Use the new extraction function
3. **Monitor improvement** - Log whether main transactions are found
4. **Add to HIL queue** - Route low-confidence extractions for review

The fix directly addresses the specific problems you mentioned:
- ✅ Finds the $3.5M purchase price
- ✅ Doesn't confuse $1M insurance as the main deal
- ✅ Labels amounts meaningfully
- ✅ Gets full party names

This should significantly improve your extraction quality without adding complexity to your architecture.
